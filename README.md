## Tonealyzer is cool
### Background

Mapping the tone of your writing to what you are trying to convey is both vitally important, and challenging to get right. Who hasn’t sent an email and had the message misunderstood as being overly aggressive or inappropriately cheery? This app leverages powerful natural language processing algorithms developed by IBM Watson to provide feedback to users on the tone of their content, so that their writing gets across its intended message.


### Functionality and MVP
- Login with username or FaceBook/Gmail via OmniAuth
Demo account with seeded data to be provided as well
- Dashboard with:
  - List of text samples submitted
  - Analytics of tone change-over-time (aka is my tone getting better)
- Text analysis show page with Watson analysis of given text sample
- Text sample submission page where user can cut/paste or type in what they want analyzed
- Production README

### Technologies
We are planning on using a Rails server and PostgreSQL database to store user information, text files, and analysis results. The front end will be written in React. The data visualizations will be done using d3 and integrated into React. We will be calling the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to obtain information on writing tone.
