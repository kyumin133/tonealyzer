Mapping the tone of your writing to what you're trying to convey is both vitally important, and challenging to get right. Who hasn't sent an email and had the message misunderstood as being overly aggressive or inappropriately cheerful? This app leverages powerful natural language processing algorithms developed by IBM Watson to provide feedback to users on the tone of their content, so that their writing gets across its intended message. Users can see previous analyses of their submissions. They can also see charts which show the results from all of their submissions in one place to make it easy for comparison.
