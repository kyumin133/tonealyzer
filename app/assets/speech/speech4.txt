So I asked her if she wanted to stay in her village when she grew up. And she smiled and said, “No, no, I want to go to Lusaka and become a nurse!” So clean water — something as basic as that — had given this child the chance to dream.

And as I learned more about water and sanitation, I was floored by the extent to which it undergirds all these problems of extreme poverty. The fate of entire communities, economies, countries is caught up in that glass of water, something the rest of us get to take for granted.

People at ONE told me that water is the least sexy and cool aspect of the effort to fight extreme poverty. And water goes hand-in-hand with sanitation. So if you think water isn’t sexy, you should try to get into the shit business.

But I was hooked already. The enormity of it, and the complexity of the issue, it just hooked me. And getting out in the world and meeting people like this little girl is what put me on the path to starting Water.org, with a brilliant civil engineer named Gary White.

For Gary and me both, seeing the world and its problems, its possibilities heightened our disbelief that so many people, millions, 660 million in fact, can’t get a safe, clean drink of water or a clean, private place to go to the bathroom. There are more people with a cell phone than access to a toilet on our planet. And this heightened our determination to do something about it.

Now you see some tough things out there. But you also see life-changing joy. And it all changes you. There was a refugee crisis back in ’09 that I read about in an amazing article in the New York Times. People were streaming across the border of Zimbabwe to a little town in northern South Africa called Messina. Well, I was working in South Africa at the time, so I went up to Messina to see for myself what was going on.
