But looking at the world as it is, and engaging with it, is the first step towards identifying our blind spots. And that’s when we can really start to understand ourselves better and begin to solve some problems.

And with that as your goal, there’s a few more things I hope you’ll keep in mind.

First, you’re going to fail sometimes, and that’s a good thing. For all the amazing successes I’ve been lucky to share in, few things have shaped me more than the auditions that Ben and I used to do as young actors, where we would get on a bus, we show up in New York, we’d wait for our turn, we’d cry our hearts out for a scene, and then be told, “OK, thanks.” Meaning: game over. We used to call it “being OK thanksed.” Those experiences became our armor.

All right. Now you’re thinking, great, thanks Matt. Failure is good. Thanks a ton. Tell me something I didn’t hear at my high school graduation. To which I say: OK, I will.

You know the real danger for MIT graduates? It’s not getting “OK thanksed.” The real danger is all that smoke that’s been blown up your … graduation gowns about how freaking smart you are. Well, you are that smart! But don’t believe the hype that’s thrown at you. You don’t have all the answers. And you shouldn’t. And that’s fine. You’re going to have your share of bad ideas. For me, one was playing a character named “Edgar Pudwhacker.” I wish I could tell you I’m making that up.

But as the great philosopher, Benjamin Affleck, once said: “Judge me by how good my good ideas are, not by how bad my bad ideas are.” You’ve got to suit up in your armor, you’ve got to get ready to sound like a total fool. Not having an answer isn’t embarrassing. It’s an opportunity. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. I know so much less the second time I’m fake graduating than the first time.
