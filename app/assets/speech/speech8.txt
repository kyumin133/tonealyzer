It’s is based on Gary’s insight that poor people were already paying for their water and they, no less than the rest of us, want to participate in their own solutions. So WaterCredit helps connect the poor with microfinance organizations, which enables them to build water connections and toilets in their homes and communities. And this approach is really working, helping 4 million people so far and it’s only the start.

Our loans are paying back at 99% and above which is a hell of a better deal than those bankers I was talking about earlier. And I agree it’s still not sexy but it is without a doubt the coolest thing I’ve ever been a part of.

So thanks – so let me ask you this in closing: What are you going to be a part of? What is the problem that you’ll try to solve? Whatever your answer, it’s not going to be easy. Sometimes your work will hit a dead-end. Sometimes your work will be measured in half-steps. Sometimes your work will make you wear a white sequined military uniform and make love to Michael Douglas. All right, maybe that’s just my work.

But for all of you here, your work starts today. And seriously, how lucky are you? I mean, what are the odds that you’re the ones who are here today? In the Earth’s 4.5 billion year run, with 100 billion people who have lived and died, and the 7 billion of us here now, here you are. Yes, here you are, alive at a time of potential extinction-level events, a time when fewer and fewer people can cause more and more damage, a time when science and technology may not hold all the answers, but are indispensable to any solution.

What are the odds that you get to be you, right now, The MIT Class of 2016, with so much on the line? There are potentially trillions of human beings who will someday exist or not, whose fate, in large part, depends on the choices you make, on your ideas, on your grit and persistence and willingness to engage.
