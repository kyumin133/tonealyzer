I spent a day speaking with women who had made this perilous journey across the Limpopo River, dodging bandits on one side, crocodiles in the river, and bandits on the other. Every woman that I spoke to that day had been raped. Every single one. On one side of the river or both.

And at the end of my time there I met a woman who was so positive, she was so joyful. She had just been given her papers, so she had been granted political asylum in South Africa. And in the midst of this joyful conversation, I mustered up my courage and I said, “Ma’am, do you mind my asking: were you assaulted on your journey to South Africa?”

And she replied, still smiling, “Oh, yes, I was raped. But I have my papers now. And those bastards didn’t get my dignity.”

Human beings will take your breath away. They will teach you so much but you have to engage. I only had that experience because I went there myself. It was difficult in many ways, but of course that’s the point.

There’s a lot of trouble out there, MIT. But there’s a lot of beauty, too. And I hope you see both.

But again, the point is not to become some kind of well-rounded, high-minded voyeur. The point is to eliminate your blind spots — the things that keep us from grasping the bigger picture. And look, even though I grew up in this neighborhood — in this incredible, multicultural neighborhood that was a little rough at that time — I find myself here before you as a middle aged American, white, male movie star. I don’t have a clue where my blind spots begin and end.
