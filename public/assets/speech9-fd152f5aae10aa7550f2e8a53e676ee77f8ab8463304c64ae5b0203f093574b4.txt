If this were a movie I was trying to pitch, I’d be laughed out of every office in Hollywood. Joseph Campbell himself would tell me to throttle down and lower the stakes. But I can’t. Because this is a fact, this is not fiction. This improbable thing is actually happening. There’s more at stake today than in any story ever told. And how lucky you are that you’re here, and you’re you. And how lucky we are that you are here and you are you.

So I hope you’ll turn toward the problem of your choosing.

I hope you’ll turn toward the problem of your choosing. I hope you will drop everything, and I hope you’ll solve it.

This is your life, Class of 2016. This is your moment, and it’s all down to you.

Ready player one. Your game begins now. Thank you. Congratulations.
